Meet a special gravitational wave. Born from the collision of two neutron stars over a billion years ago, it traveled across the Universe to finally reach Earth. The birth of this gravitational wave came with a burst of light, an event known as a bright siren, and helped scientists to uncover the Universe's secrets.
