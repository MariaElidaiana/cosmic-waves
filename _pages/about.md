Meet a special gravitational wave (G-wave). Born from the collision of two neutron stars over a billion years ago, it traveled across the Universe to finally reach Earth. This G-wave's birth came with a burst of light, making it a "bright siren" and is helping scientists to uncover the Universe's secrets.
